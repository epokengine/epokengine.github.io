# HUD and 2D entities

Create Canvas, Panel, Image, Text or Progress Bar through GameObject > UI or Hierarchy's context menu. UniQo adds a Canvas automatically when necessary. These are ordinary scene entities with hierarchy, scripts, renaming, duplication and persistence.

Panel combines RectTransform and Image. Text and ProgressBar are independent graphics components. Add Component can add Canvas to an empty root entity, RectTransform to a UI child, and graphics to an entity with RectTransform.

## Layout

Scene's **2D** button opens Canvas editing. Select an element to drag it, or resize it from its lower-right corner. Inspector exposes Anchor Min/Max, Pivot, Position and Size Delta with anchor presets.

Anchors and pivots range from 0 to 1. Positions use reference pixels with +Y pointing up. Size Delta adds to the space between anchors so elements can stretch with their parent. Reparenting with world preservation keeps the visible rectangle.

The Canvas mode is **Screen Space - Overlay** at the resolution selected in [Project Settings](settings.md), 640 x 480 by default. Positions and sizes use native pixels; anchors follow the canvas size. PSX draws it after the 3D world. The 3D Transform does not change RectTransform layout. Draw order is parents before children and siblings in creation order.

Graphics clip to the Canvas, not their parent's rectangle. Text is limited to its own width. Disabling Canvas hides its subtree; graphics also have Enabled flags.

## Native component access

```cpp
if (auto* bar = entity().get<uniqo::ProgressBar>())
    bar->value = 0.5;
if (auto* label = uniqo::find_entity("Score"))
    if (auto* text = label->get<uniqo::Text>())
        text->set_text("SCORE 00100");
```

Entities and components can also be created in C++:

```cpp
auto* canvas = uniqo::create_entity("HUD");
if (!canvas) return;
canvas->add<uniqo::Canvas>();

auto* label = uniqo::create_entity("Score", canvas);
if (!label) return;
auto& rect = label->add<uniqo::RectTransform>();
rect.anchor_min[0] = rect.anchor_max[0] = rect.pivot[0] = 0.0;
rect.anchor_min[1] = rect.anchor_max[1] = rect.pivot[1] = 1.0;
rect.position[0] = 12.0;
rect.position[1] = -12.0;
rect.size[0] = 160.0;
rect.size[1] = 16.0;
label->add<uniqo::Text>().set_text("SCORE 00000");
```

Add RectTransform before graphics, beneath a Canvas or another RectTransform. Use `EntityHandle` for references that must detect destruction or scene changes. `destroy_entity` releases a runtime slot for reuse; creation returns null when all 32 additional slots are occupied. Play changes are not saved into authored scene files.

## Current limits

Image supports an imported Texture UUID and an atlas rectangle in pixels. Zero width/height selects the remaining texture from the specified origin. Transparent texels reveal previously drawn content. Optional left/top/right/bottom nine-slice borders preserve corner sizes while stretching the center; small destination rectangles shrink borders proportionally.

Text uses the attributed mig68000 8 × 16 bitmap with derived Spanish glyphs: `áéíóúüñÁÉÍÓÚÜÑ¿¡`. It accepts up to 511 UTF-8 bytes, explicit newlines and optional character wrapping. Text clips to its own complete glyph cells and the screen. ProgressBar retains its fill/background colors.

The scene's `hud_budget` configures layouts, rectangles, text components and glyphs. Defaults are 128 / 256 / 64 / 1024; maximums are 128 / 512 / 64 / 2048. Edit them in Project Settings > Rendering. Nine-slice images budget nine rectangles. The editor rejects authored over-budget scenes; dynamic excess is omitted and counted in `hud_stats.dropped`. Standalone builds reserve the maximum requested by their registered scenes.

`utility.hpp` supplies generic `Focus`, `EventQueue`, and `layout_list` APIs. Focus skips inactive/destroyed handles, supports forward/reverse navigation, and emits activation/cancel events. These are primitives for the game's UI logic. Parent masks, rotated rectangles, scalable text and world-space Canvas remain outside this profile.

The editor and PSX use the same generated bitmap data. Font and derived glyph attribution is preserved in [third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
