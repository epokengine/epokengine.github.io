## `psyqo::GPU::armPeriodicTimer`

**Purpose.** Creates a periodic timer.

**Details.** This method will create a periodic timer. The timer will fire every `period` microseconds. See the `armTimer` method for more information about timers in general. Periodic timers will first fire at `now() + period` microseconds, and then every `period` microseconds thereafter. They will never be canceled automatically.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
unsigned armPeriodicTimer(uint32_t period, eastl::function<void(uint32_t)> &&callback)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 461](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L461)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `period` | `uint32_t` | Input | The period of the timer in microseconds. |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void (uint32_t)> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback function to be called when the timer expires. |

**Returns.** The id of the created timer.

**Use it when.** This method will create a periodic timer. The timer will fire every `period` microseconds. See the `armTimer` method for more information about timers in general. Periodic timers will first fire at `now() + period` microseconds, and then every `period` microseconds thereafter. They will never be canceled automatically.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uint32_t period
// eastl::function<void (uint32_t)> && callback

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.armPeriodicTimer(period, callback);
```

**Why choose it.** The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-armtimer-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::armTimer`

**Purpose.** Creates a single-use timer.

**Details.** This method will create a single-use timer. The timer will fire after the specified deadline has passed. Timers will only fire during the idle period of the CPU, for example during calls to `sendFragment`, or between calls to the `frame` method of the current scene. If the scene takes too long to compute, timers may significantly be delayed past their set deadline. The deadline can be computed based on the return value of the `now()` method. It is okay if the deadline rolls over their 32 bits span. Simply doing `gpu().now() + DELAY_IN_MICROSECONDS` will still work, as long as the delay isn't greater than 30 minutes. Single-use timers will automatically be disabled upon being fired, and their id will no longer be valid. The returned id is guaranteed to be unique across active timers, but may collision with the id of timers that got canceled or got disabled on their own.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
uintptr_t armTimer(uint32_t deadline, eastl::function<void(uint32_t)> &&callback)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 435](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L435)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deadline` | `uint32_t` | Input | The deadline of the timer in microseconds. |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void (uint32_t)> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback function to be called when the timer expires. |

**Returns.** The id of the created timer.

**Use it when.** This method will create a single-use timer. The timer will fire after the specified deadline has passed.

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uint32_t deadline
// eastl::function<void (uint32_t)> && callback

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.armTimer(deadline, callback);
```

**Why choose it.** The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-canceltimer-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::cancelTimer`

**Purpose.** Cancels a timer.

**Details.** This method will cancel an active timer. The timer will no longer fire. Its id will no longer be valid.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void cancelTimer(uintptr_t id)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 508](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L508)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uintptr_t` | Input | The id of the timer to cancel. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** This method will cancel an active timer. The timer will no longer fire. Its id will no longer be valid.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uintptr_t id

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.cancelTimer(id);
```

**Why choose it.** The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-chain-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::chain`

**Purpose.** Chains an already constructed DMA chain to the next DMA chain transfer.

**Details.** This method will chain an already constructed DMA chain to the next DMA chain transfer. This is an even more complex operation than the previous `chain` method, as it requires the user to construct the DMA chain manually. Some helpers are provided in the `Fragments` namespace.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <Fragment Frag1, Fragment Frag2> void chain(Frag1 *first, Frag2 *last)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 334](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L334)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `first` | `Frag1 *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The pointer to the first fragment of the chain. |
| `last` | `Frag2 *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The pointer to the last fragment of the chain. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** This method will chain an already constructed DMA chain to the next DMA chain transfer. This is an even more complex operation than the previous `chain` method, as it requires the user to construct the DMA chain manually. Some helpers are provided in the `Fragments` namespace.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// Frag1, Frag2

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Frag1 * first
// Frag2 * last

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.chain<Frag1, Frag2>(first, last);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection. The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-chain-2"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::chain`

**Purpose.** Chains a fragment to the next DMA chain transfer.

**Details.** This method will chain a fragment to the next DMA chain transfer. DMA Chaining is a complex operation, and it is recommended that you use the `sendFragment` method instead if you are unsure. This can be used while a DMA chain is being sent. Use the `sendChain` method to transfer the DMA chain during the current frame, or simply return from the current scene's `frame` method to transfer the DMA chain automatically during the frame flip operation. Note that the latter means the DMA chain will render on the _next_ rendered frame, thus creating a sort of triple buffering system. The constructed DMA chain will thus need to be using the `Next` variants of the primitive constructors, if applicable.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <Fragment Frag> void chain(Frag &fragment)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 320](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L320)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fragment` | `Frag &` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The fragment to chain. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

## `psyqo::GPU::chain`

**Purpose.** Chains an ordering table to the next DMA chain transfer.

**Details.** This method will chain an ordering table to the next DMA chain transfer. The ordering table table will be cleared automatically after the transfer is complete.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <size_t N, Safe safety = Safe::Yes> void chain(OrderingTable<N, safety> &table)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 349](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L349)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `table` | `OrderingTable<N, safety> &` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The ordering table to chain. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** This method will chain an ordering table to the next DMA chain transfer. The ordering table table will be cleared automatically after the transfer is complete.

#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:

<a id="psyqo-gpu-changetimerperiod-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::changeTimerPeriod`

**Purpose.** Changes the period of a periodic timer.

**Details.** This method will change the period of a periodic timer. The timer now will fire every `period` microseconds instead of its previous period. When the `reset` argument is false, the next deadline for the timer will be adjusted according to the difference between the new period and the previous one. If the new period is shorter, and the deadline goes in the past, the timer will fire as soon as possible. When the `reset` argument is true, the new deadline will simply be set to the new `period`. This method has no effect if the timer is not periodic.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void changeTimerPeriod(uintptr_t id, uint32_t period, bool reset = false)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 477](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L477)

<a id="psyqo-gpu-now-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::now`

**Purpose.** Gets the current timestamp in microseconds.

**Details.** The current timestamp is in microseconds. It will wrap around after a bit more than an hour, so it shouldn't be used for deadlines that are more than 30 minutes away. This relies on root counter 1 set in hsync mode without any target value. The value will be updated during the idle moments of the page flip, without relying on interrupts. The precision isn't really good, as it assumes one scanline runs at 64us, but it should be good enough for most purposes. Creating a stopwatch out of it should show that it's running a bit too fast, approximately 1 second too fast every minute or so. Its monotonicity should be proper however. The method `now()` should be reserved for interacting with timers. If longer span is required, with more accuracy but less precision, for something that's not related with timers, then the current amount of time in seconds since the application started can simply be obtained using `getFrameCount() / getRefreshRate()`.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
uint32_t now() const

## `psyqo::GPU::sendChain`

**Purpose.** Initiates the transfer of the current DMA chain.

**Details.** See the non-blocking variant of `uploadToVRAM` for more information about asynchronous transfers.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void sendChain(eastl::function<void()> &&callback, DMA::DmaCallback dmaCallback = DMA::FROM_MAIN_LOOP)

- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void ()> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback to call upon completion. |
| `dmaCallback` | `DMA::DmaCallback` | Callback | `DMA::FROM_MAIN_LOOP` or `DMA::FROM_ISR`. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** See the non-blocking variant of `uploadToVRAM` for more information about asynchronous transfers.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// eastl::function<void ()> && callback
// DMA::DmaCallback dmaCallback

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.sendChain(callback, dmaCallback);
```

**Why choose it.** The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-sendfragment-1"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::sendFragment`

**Purpose.** Immediately sends a fragment to the GPU. This is a blocking operation. See the fragments.hh file for more information.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <Fragment Frag> void sendFragment(const Frag &fragment)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 222](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/gpu.hh#L222)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fragment` | `const Frag &` | Input | The fragment to send to the GPU. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need GPU setup, command submission and frame synchronization and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// Frag

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const Frag & fragment

psyqo::GPU& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.sendFragment<Frag>(fragment);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection. The API maps closely to PSX GPU work, giving predictable ordering and low overhead.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Respect packet lifetime, ordering-table direction and per-frame GPU/VRAM budgets; submission is not a desktop immediate-mode draw call.

<a id="psyqo-gpu-uploadtovram-2"></a>

## `psyqo::GPU::uploadToVRAM`

**Purpose.** Uploads a buffer to the VRAM as a non-blocking call.

**Details.** This method will initiate an upload of the specified set of pixels to the VRAM, at the specified location and size. The GPU cache will be flushed. It will return immediately, and the upload will be performed in the background. Upon completion, the specified callback will be called. If `dmaCallback` is set to `FROM_ISR`, the callback will be called from the interrupt handler, and care must be taken to properly synchronize variable changes. Please use the EASTL's `atomic_signal_fence` function for this purpose. If `dmaCallback` is set to `FROM_MAIN_LOOP`, the callback will be called in the same execution context as the main loop, and it is therefore safe to access variables there. The callback will thus be called between calls to the current scene's `frame` method, or during `Kernel::pumpCallbacks()`. Note that during the upload, no GPU operation should be performed.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void uploadToVRAM(const uint16_t *data, Rect region, eastl::function<void()> &&callback, DMA::DmaCallback dmaCallback = DMA::FROM_MAIN_LOOP)

- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `long double` | Input | Value supplied for `value`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `uint32_t`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need GPU setup, command submission and frame synchronization and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/gpu.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// long double value

auto result = psyqo::timer_literals::operator""_ns(value);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to GPU setup, command submission and frame synchronization. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Call it only in the lifecycle phase described by the module. Validate indices, capacities and object state before use.

## `psyqo::timer_literals::operator""_ns`

**Purpose.** Literal operators for time units.

**Details.** These operators can be used to specify time units suitable for the GPU's `armTimer` and `armPeriodicTimer` methods. For example, `gpu().armPeriodicTimer(1_s, callback)` will create a timer that fires every second.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
consteval uint32_t operator""_ns(unsigned long long int value)
