## `psyqo::CDRom::readSectors`

**Purpose.** Read a sector from the CDRom.

**Details.** The function will make reasonable attempts at reading the disk, but it is not guaranteed to succeed. Failures may be caused by the disk being faulty, the lid being opened, or no valid disk being present. Only one operation can be in progress at a time.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
virtual void readSectors(uint32_t sector, uint32_t count, void *buffer, eastl::function<void(bool)> &&callback) = 0
```

- **Declared at:** [line 99](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L99)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `virtual`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sector` | `uint32_t` | Input | The sector to read. |
| `count` | `uint32_t` | Input | Value supplied for `count`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `buffer` | `void *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The buffer to read into. |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void (bool)> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback to call when the read is done. It will be called from the main thread when possible. Its one argument is a boolean indicating whether the read was successful. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** The function will make reasonable attempts at reading the disk, but it is not guaranteed to succeed. Failures may be caused by the disk being faulty, the lid being opened, or no valid disk being present. Only one operation can be in progress at a time.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uint32_t sector
// uint32_t count
// void * buffer
// eastl::function<void (bool)> && callback

psyqo::CDRom& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.readSectors(sector, count, buffer, callback);
```

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="psyqo-cdrom-readsectorsawaiter-await-ready-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter::await_ready`

**Purpose.** Performs `await ready` as part of the cdrom module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
constexpr bool await_ready() const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 51](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L51)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.await_ready();
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

<a id="psyqo-cdrom-readsectorsawaiter-await-resume-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter::await_resume`

**Purpose.** Performs `await resume` as part of the cdrom module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
bool await_resume()
```

- **Declared at:** [line 59](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L59)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.await_resume();
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

<a id="psyqo-cdrom-readsectorsawaiter-await-suspend-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter::await_suspend`

**Purpose.** Performs `await suspend` as part of the cdrom module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <typename U> void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<U> handle)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 53](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L53)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handle` | `std::coroutine_handle<U>` | Input | Value supplied for `handle`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// U

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// std::coroutine_handle<U> handle

psyqo::CDRom::ReadSectorsAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.await_suspend<U>(handle);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

```

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
ReadSectorsAwaiter readSectorsForCoroutine(uint32_t sector, uint32_t count, void *buffer)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 139](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L139)

| `count` | `uint32_t` | Input | The number of sectors to read. |
| `buffer` | `void *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The buffer to read into. |

**Returns.** ReadSectorsAwaiter The awaitable object to be used with the `co_await` keyword.

**Use it when.** This method will return an `Awaiter` object that can be used to suspend the coroutine until the read operation is complete. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the `co_await` keyword, in a coroutine.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uint32_t sector
// uint32_t count
// void * buffer

psyqo::CDRom& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.readSectorsForCoroutine(sector, count, buffer);
```

<a id="psyqo-cdrom-schedulereadrequest-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRom::scheduleReadRequest`

**Purpose.** Schedule a read operation.

**Details.** This is a convenience function that will schedule a read operation and return a task that can be waited on. The difference with `scheduleReadSectors` is that this method will read its arguments right before the operation is processed, so the request data can be filled in at the last moment.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
TaskQueue::Task scheduleReadRequest(const ReadRequest *request)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 125](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom.hh#L125)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `request` | `const ReadRequest *` | Input | The request to schedule. |

**Returns.** A task that can be queued into a `TaskQueue`

**Use it when.** This is a convenience function that will schedule a read operation and return a task that can be waited on. The difference with `scheduleReadSectors` is that this method will read its arguments right before the operation is processed, so the request data can be filled in at the last moment.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const ReadRequest * request

psyqo::CDRom& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.scheduleReadRequest(request);
```

**Why choose it.** The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Captured data and buffers must remain valid until the callback or task has completed. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

psyqo::CDRom& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.scheduleReadSectors(sector, count, buffer);
```

**Why choose it.** The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.
