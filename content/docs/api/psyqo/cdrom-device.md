**Exact declaration**

```cpp
const char *name() const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 197](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L197)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Returns.** Returns `const char *`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

psyqo::CDRomDevice::ActionBase& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.name();
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::getTOCSize`

**Purpose.** Gets the size of the Table of Contents from the CDRom. Note that while the blocking variant is available because it is a fairly short operation with the CDRom controller, it can still block the system for roughly 2ms, which is a long time in the context of a 33MHz CPU.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void getTOCSize(unsigned *size, eastl::function<void(bool)> &&callback)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 276](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L276)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `unsigned int *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | The pointer to store the size of the TOC. |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void (bool)> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback to call when the size is retrieved. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// unsigned int * size
// eastl::function<void (bool)> && callback

psyqo::CDRomDevice& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.getTOCSize(size, callback);
```

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

psyqo::CDRomDevice::GetTOCSizeAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.await_ready();
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

Unlike other APIs here, upon success, the callback will be called *twice*: once when the playback actually started, and once when the playback is complete or paused, which can be after the end of the track, at the end of the disc if the last track is reached, or if the playback is paused or stopped using the `pauseCDDA` or `stopCDDA` methods. The first callback will be called with `true` if the playback started successfully, and `false` if it failed. In the case of failure, the second callback will not be called. The Track variant will stop playback at the end of the track, while the Disc variant will stop playback at the end of the disc. The resume method can be used to resume playback after a pause. Its callback argument will function similarly to the callback argument of the `playCDDA` methods.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void playCDDATrack(MSF start, eastl::function<void(bool)> &&callback)
```

| `start` | `MSF` | Input | The starting point for playback. |
| `callback` | `eastl::function<void (bool)> &&` | Consumed or moved input | The callback to call when playback is complete. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** This method will begin playing CDDA audio from a given starting point. The starting point is either a track number or an MSF value.

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::ResetAwaiter::await_suspend`

**Purpose.** Performs `await suspend` as part of the cdrom device module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <typename U> void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<U> handle)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 94](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L94)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handle` | `std::coroutine_handle<U>` | Input | Value supplied for `handle`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// U

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// std::coroutine_handle<U> handle

psyqo::CDRomDevice::ResetAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.await_suspend<U>(handle);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

<a id="psyqo-cdromdevice-setvolume-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::setVolume`

**Purpose.** Set the Volume of the CDDA audio.

**Details.** This method will set the volume of the CDDA audio. The volume is set using four values, which represent the volume of the left channel to the left speaker, the right channel to the left speaker, the left channel to the right speaker, and the right channel to the right speaker. The given output value should be in the range of 0 to 128, where 0 is silence and 128 is full volume. The values for a given output speaker will be added together, so clipping can occur if the sum of the values is greater than 128. The method can be used at any time, unlike the mute/unmute methods, which can only be used when the drive is idle. The normal volume setting is 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80.

bool await_ready() const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 163](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L163)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.await_ready();
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter::await_resume`

**Purpose.** Performs `await resume` as part of the cdrom device module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
bool await_resume()
```

- **Declared at:** [line 171](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L171)

<a id="psyqo-cdromdevice-unmuteawaiter-await-suspend-1"></a>

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter::await_suspend`

**Purpose.** Performs `await suspend` as part of the cdrom device module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template <typename U> void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<U> handle)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 165](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L165)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handle` | `std::coroutine_handle<U>` | Input | Value supplied for `handle`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// U

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// std::coroutine_handle<U> handle

psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.await_suspend<U>(handle);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.

## `psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter::UnmuteAwaiter`

**Purpose.** Constructs `psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter` for the cdrom device module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
UnmuteAwaiter(CDRomDevice &device) : m_dev
```

- **Declared at:** [line 162](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/blob/6186b131aacc5853a9161fb076ed34ffe504552d/psyqo/cdrom-device.hh#L162)
- **Kind:** `constructor`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `device` | `CDRomDevice &` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | Value supplied for `device`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Use it when.** You need the cdrom device module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "psyqo/cdrom-device.hh"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// CDRomDevice & device

psyqo::CDRomDevice::UnmuteAwaiter value(device);
```

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.
