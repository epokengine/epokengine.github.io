## `epok::effects::Pool::advance`

**Purpose.** Call after the director, before the single particle simulation step.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void advance(Fixed dt,bool paused=false)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 145](../../../runtime/particle_effect_runtime.hpp#L145)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dt` | `Fixed` | Input | Value supplied for `dt`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `paused` | `bool` | Input | Value supplied for `paused`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need runtime effects and their deterministic playback state and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particle_effect_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Fixed dt
// bool paused

epok::effects::Pool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.advance(dt, paused);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to runtime effects and their deterministic playback state. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.

<a id="epok-effects-pool-burst-1"></a>

## `epok::effects::Pool::burst`

**Purpose.** Performs `burst` as part of runtime effects and their deterministic playback state.

auto result = object.burst(h, count);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions.

**Purpose.** Performs `state` as part of runtime effects and their deterministic playback state.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
State state(Handle h)const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 70](../../../runtime/particle_effect_runtime.hpp#L70)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `h` | `Handle` | Input | Value supplied for `h`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `State`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need runtime effects and their deterministic playback state and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particle_effect_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Handle h

epok::effects::Pool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.state(h);
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.

## `epok::effects::Pool::stop`

**Purpose.** Stops stop as part of runtime effects and their deterministic playback state.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
bool stop(Handle h)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 116](../../../runtime/particle_effect_runtime.hpp#L116)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `h` | `Handle` | Input | Value supplied for `h`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need runtime effects and their deterministic playback state and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particle_effect_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Handle h

epok::effects::Pool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.stop(h);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.

<a id="epok-effects-pool-tint-1"></a>

## `epok::effects::Pool::tint`

**Purpose.** Performs `tint` as part of runtime effects and their deterministic playback state.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
static void tint(const EffectLayer& layer,Sprite& sprite)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 180](../../../runtime/particle_effect_runtime.hpp#L180)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `static`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layer` | `const EffectLayer &` | Input | Value supplied for `layer`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `sprite` | `Sprite &` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | Value supplied for `sprite`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need runtime effects and their deterministic playback state and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particle_effect_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const EffectLayer & layer
// Sprite & sprite

epok::effects::Pool::tint(layer, sprite);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to runtime effects and their deterministic playback state. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="epok-effects-pool-pool-3"></a>

## `epok::effects::Pool::~Pool`

**Purpose.** Releases the resources owned by `epok::effects::Pool`.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
~Pool()
```

- **Declared at:** [line 69](../../../runtime/particle_effect_runtime.hpp#L69)
- **Kind:** `destructor`

**Use it when.** You need runtime effects and their deterministic playback state and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particle_effect_runtime.hpp"

// `epok::effects::Pool` cleans up when its owning scope ends.
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to runtime effects and their deterministic playback state. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.
