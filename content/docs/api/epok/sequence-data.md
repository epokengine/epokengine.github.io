## `epok::psx_audio::Bank::is_library`

**Purpose.** Reports whether library as part of the sequence data module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
bool is_library() const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 31](../../../runtime/sequence_data.hpp#L31)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the sequence data module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "sequence_data.hpp"

epok::psx_audio::Bank& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.is_library();
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.
