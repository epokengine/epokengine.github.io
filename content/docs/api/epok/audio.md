## `epok::audio_initialize`

**Purpose.** Performs `audio initialize` as part of SPU sound playback and voice ownership.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
inline bool audio_initialize(const AudioClip* clips,size_t count)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 16](../../../runtime/audio.hpp#L16)
- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clips` | `const AudioClip *` | Input | Value supplied for `clips`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `count` | `size_t` | Input | Value supplied for `count`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need SPU sound playback and voice ownership and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "audio.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const AudioClip * clips
// size_t count

auto result = epok::audio_initialize(clips, count);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

## `epok::audio_keyoff`

**Purpose.** Performs `audio keyoff` as part of SPU sound playback and voice ownership.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
inline void audio_keyoff(int voice)

- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `voice` | `int` | Input | Value supplied for `voice`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need SPU sound playback and voice ownership and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "audio.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// int voice

epok::audio_keyoff(voice);
```

**Why choose it.** The API exposes the hardware service without hiding latency or bounded memory.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Treat device absence, busy state and I/O failure as expected outcomes; do not block the frame loop waiting for hardware.
