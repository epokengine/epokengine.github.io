- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `static`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `instance` | `Behaviour *` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | Value supplied for `instance`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "blueprint_spawn.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Behaviour * instance

epok::bp::TypedPool::release(instance);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

## `epok::bp::visit`

**Purpose.** Visit only bindings that existed at dispatch start.

**Details.** Generations and serials prevent a callback-created replacement from receiving the old slot's event.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template<class Callback> inline void visit(Callback callback)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 100](../../../runtime/blueprint_spawn.hpp#L100)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `callback` | `Callback` | Callback | Value supplied for `callback`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** Generations and serials prevent a callback-created replacement from receiving the old slot's event.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "blueprint_spawn.hpp"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// Callback

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Callback callback

epok::bp& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.visit<Callback>(callback);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size.
