<a id="epok-bp-add-1"></a>

## `epok::bp::add`

**Purpose.** Adds add as part of compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
inline Fixed add(Fixed a, Fixed b)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 29](../../../runtime/blueprint_runtime.hpp#L29)
- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | `Fixed` | Input | Value supplied for `a`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `b` | `Fixed` | Input | Value supplied for `b`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `Fixed`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "blueprint_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Fixed a
// Fixed b

auto result = epok::bp::add(a, b);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.

<a id="epok-bp-add-2"></a>

## `epok::bp::add`

**Purpose.** Adds add as part of compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template<size_t Size> inline Vector<Size> add(const Vector<Size>& a, const Vector<Size>& b)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 48](../../../runtime/blueprint_runtime.hpp#L48)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | `const Vector<Size> &` | Input | Value supplied for `a`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `b` | `const Vector<Size> &` | Input | Value supplied for `b`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `Vector<Size>`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "blueprint_runtime.hpp"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// Size

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const Vector<Size> & a
// const Vector<Size> & b

epok::bp& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.add<Size>(a, b);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

auto result = object.mul<Size>(a, b);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

| `b` | `uint32_t` | Input | Value supplied for `b`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `uint32_t`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "blueprint_runtime.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// uint32_t a
// uint32_t b

auto result = epok::bp::udiv(a, b);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.

| `index` | `size_t` | Input | Value supplied for `index`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `Fixed &`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need compiled Blueprint execution and object interaction and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// size_t index

epok::bp::Vector& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.operator[](index);
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control.
