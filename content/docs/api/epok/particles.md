## `epok::ParticlePool::advance`

**Purpose.** Performs `advance` as part of bounded particle simulation and rendering.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
template<size_t N>void advance(std::array<Object,N>& objects,const std::array<Affine<Fixed>,N>& world,size_t count,Fixed dt)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 71](../../../runtime/particles.hpp#L71)
- **Kind:** `function template`; qualifiers: `template`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objects` | `std::array<Object, N> &` | Input/output; inspect the function contract | Value supplied for `objects`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `world` | `const std::array<Affine<Fixed>, N> &` | Input | Value supplied for `world`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `count` | `size_t` | Input | Value supplied for `count`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `dt` | `Fixed` | Input | Value supplied for `dt`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need bounded particle simulation and rendering and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particles.hpp"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// N

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// std::array<Object, N> & objects
// const std::array<Affine<Fixed>, N> & world
// size_t count
// Fixed dt

epok::ParticlePool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.advance<N>(objects, world, count, dt);
```

**Why choose it.** Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "particles.hpp"

// Replace these template arguments with types or values accepted by the declaration:
// N, Emit

// size_t count
// Emit emit

epok::ParticlePool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.each<N, Emit>(arg1, count, emit);
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need bounded particle simulation and rendering and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

// Emit

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Emit emit

epok::ParticlePool& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.each_all<Emit>(emit);
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. Template dispatch is resolved at compile time and normally adds no runtime indirection.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Every instantiated type must satisfy the header's compile-time requirements; extra instantiations can increase code size.

<a id="epok-particlepool-emitter-1"></a>

```

- **Declared at:** [line 35](../../../runtime/particles.hpp#L35)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owner` | `timeline::BoundTarget` | Input | Value supplied for `owner`. See the exact type and module contract. |

auto result = object.emitter(owner, emitter, world);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.
