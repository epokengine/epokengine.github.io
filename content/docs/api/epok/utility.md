## `epok::ease`

**Purpose.** Q12 easing.

**Details.** Every curve returns exactly 0 at t=0 and exactly 4096 at t=1, which is what lets Tween::advance land on `to` the moment elapsed reaches duration. The In/Out halves double the argument before taking the power rather than scaling a truncated power afterwards: scaling afterwards costs an order of magnitude of accuracy by the fifth power. SmoothStep, InQuad and OutQuad keep their original expressions so already authored tweens keep their exact shape; OutQuad therefore truncates the whole product instead of only the square.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
inline Fixed ease(Fixed t,Ease kind)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 24](../../../runtime/utility.hpp#L24)
- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `t` | `Fixed` | Input | Value supplied for `t`. See the exact type and module contract. |
| `kind` | `Ease` | Input | Value supplied for `kind`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `Fixed`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** Every curve returns exactly 0 at t=0 and exactly 4096 at t=1, which is what lets Tween::advance land on `to` the moment elapsed reaches duration. The In/Out halves double the argument before taking the power rather than scaling a truncated power afterwards: scaling afterwards costs an order of magnitude of accuracy by the fifth power. SmoothStep, InQuad and OutQuad keep their original expressions so already authored tweens keep their exact shape; OutQuad therefore truncates the whole product instead of only the square.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "utility.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// Fixed t
// Ease kind

auto result = epok::ease(t, kind);
```

**Why choose it.** It provides direct, allocation-conscious access to the utility module. No exception-based error path is implied by the signature.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Call it only in the lifecycle phase described by the module. Validate indices, capacities and object state before use.

<a id="epok-eventqueue-clear-1"></a>

## `epok::EventQueue::clear`

**Purpose.** Clears clear as part of the utility module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
void clear()
```

- **Declared at:** [line 108](../../../runtime/utility.hpp#L108)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Returns.** No value is returned; observe the documented state change or callback.

**Use it when.** You need the utility module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "utility.hpp"

epok::EventQueue& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

object.clear();
```

**Why choose it.** The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Captured data and buffers must remain valid until the callback or task has completed.

<a id="epok-eventqueue-emit-1"></a>

## `epok::EventQueue::emit`

**Purpose.** Performs `emit` as part of the utility module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
bool emit(QueueEvent event)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 106](../../../runtime/utility.hpp#L106)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `event` | `QueueEvent` | Input | Value supplied for `event`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** You need the utility module and the preconditions in the declaration are already satisfied.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "utility.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// QueueEvent event

epok::EventQueue& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.emit(event);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Captured data and buffers must remain valid until the callback or task has completed.

<a id="epok-eventqueue-poll-1"></a>

## `epok::EventQueue::poll`

**Purpose.** Polls poll as part of the utility module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp

```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions. The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. Captured data and buffers must remain valid until the callback or task has completed. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

<a id="epok-eventqueue-restore-1"></a>

## `epok::EventQueue::restore`

**Purpose.** Performs `restore` as part of the utility module.

**Exact declaration**

## `epok::EventQueue::size`

**Purpose.** Performs `size` as part of the utility module.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
size_t size()const
```

- **Declared at:** [line 108](../../../runtime/utility.hpp#L108)
- **Kind:** `cxx method`; qualifiers: `const`

auto result = object.snapshot(output, capacity);
```

**Why choose it.** The method is `const`, so it does not mutate the object through this API surface. The asynchronous shape lets the frame loop continue while hardware or queued work completes.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Captured data and buffers must remain valid until the callback or task has completed. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.
