## `epok::mesh_faces_unlit`

**Purpose.** An imported editable mesh owns per-face materials.

**Details.** The actor tint can still have its default lit flag even when every face explicitly opts out.

**Exact declaration**

```cpp
inline bool mesh_faces_unlit(const MeshGeometry* geometry)
```

- **Declared at:** [line 19](../../../runtime/retained.hpp#L19)
- **Kind:** `function decl`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `geometry` | `const MeshGeometry *` | Input | Value supplied for `geometry`. See the exact type and module contract. |

**Returns.** Returns `bool`. Check the purpose and failure notes before using the value.

**Use it when.** The actor tint can still have its default lit flag even when every face explicitly opts out.

**Usage pattern**

```cpp
#include "retained.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const MeshGeometry * geometry

auto result = epok::mesh_faces_unlit(geometry);
```

**Why choose it.** The boolean result makes success, availability or state explicit without exceptions.

**Trade-offs and warnings.** Check the return value; `false` is part of normal control flow for many PSX resource operations. This is classified as **Engine internal**. Prefer a higher-level Epok service unless you need this exact control. Pointer/reference arguments are borrowed unless the source contract says otherwise; keep them valid for the complete operation and never assume null is accepted.

| Name | Type | Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | `const MeshGeometry *` | Input | Value supplied for `source`. See the exact type and module contract. |

#include "retained.hpp"

// Assume these named values have been initialized with valid data:
// const MeshGeometry * source

epok::MeshMaterialCache& object = /* obtain a valid instance */;

auto result = object.faces_unlit(source);
